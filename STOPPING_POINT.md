# Stopping point — 2026-10-07

Work is on `main`, fast-forwarded to the incoming production tree at `55e3300`. Commits are authored as shimian5. The owner authorized local full Quartus flows in unsandboxed PowerShell. No PR has been opened.

## Local checkpoint and immediate continuation

Latest completed flow: `444211d`, zero compile errors, **master setup -0.427 ns**, audio +24.847 ns. All five added counter clocks pass reported setup/hold; minimum overall hold +0.204 ns. All eight negative setup paths are the registered audio byte to the master byte register. No build is running. RBF remains unaccepted; releases are unchanged. [Final build evidence and next repair](docs/audits/source/local-counter-clock-build-2026-10-07.md).

The reset mux is gone but the asynchronous destination FF path still fails. Next bounded unit: evaluate a normal data register plus separately reset validity/output mask, prove identical reset/latency/PIA behavior, then run a full flow. Keep byte timing constraints intact. The fitter repaired previously exposed PH6 hold paths without waivers; remaining gated/event-clock coverage, reset contracts, firmware coherence and hardware/game acceptance stay open.

Stopped after the completed build review to preserve the requested usage reserve. At the last check the five-hour window was 97% used; the weekly window was 15% used. Do not start another build or worker block until continuation is requested. Existing owner probe files are the only dirty changes.

Reviewed evidence:

- Fresh MAME audio-RAM replay: 11 PASS, zero FAIL/SKIP, three mirror traces and flat-map negative control. Guarded 6840 timer window passes pitch medians 0.997; waveform/noise/levels remain open.
- PIA pipeline passes seven related-clock offsets and actual Verilog checks. Four-game passive firmware capture and reproducible DDR-qualified analysis show repeated Venture responses, zero-only Mouse Trap responses, and startup-limited Pepper II/Hard Hat traffic. Seven Venture mismatches and overwritten responses remain follow-up evidence.
- Unchanged 8253 passes mode 0/3, raw mode-7 alias, live divisor changes and warm reset. PCM equivalence remains open.
- Standalone Teeter spinner/D-pad/analog and FAX four-button-per-player helpers pass. Teeter's 17-part MRA candidate passes metadata/loading audit; actual controls and 600 Hz NMI remain unwired; standalone NMI period and actual-T65 pause/vector fixtures pass. These are not working-game releases.
- Local Z80 source exists. Standalone speech-ROM wait/reset-drain helper passes, but actual CPU fetch, variable-latency expansion reset, CVSD and audio mix remain integration gates.
- Profile-0 sprite replay passes; Venture inside-room arrow is still unreproduced.

Owner test paths: HDMI and Direct Video through S-Video to a 15 kHz JVC. Teeter requires spinner plus joystick/D-pad following local Super Off Road; FAX requires four answer buttons per player in its MRA. Record exact display/adapter/settings and running RBF/MRA at hardware acceptance. No additional input is needed for the immediate timing work.

Read [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) for production rollback commits and [WORKPLAN.md](WORKPLAN.md) for remaining game/issue gates. Owner probe files and increment-14 metadata changes are preserved. Release files and ROM archives are unchanged.

## Production changes since the baseline (all unproven on hardware)

| Change | Files | Evidence | Build / test status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mono mix of both audio groups (A1) | `rtl/audio_mix.v`, `rtl/audio_board.v` | `sim/audio_mix` unit test | Not listened to; levels versus MAME unverified |
| Profile-selected collision wiring for `$5103` (S2/S3), selected by `pcb[7:6]`; profile 0 = unchanged | `rtl/int_cause.v`, `rtl/Exidy2.v`, `candidates/mra/*` | `sim/int_cause` vs MAME formula and all observed `$5103` values | Release MRAs untouched; test MRAs in `candidates/mra`; profile-0 sprite fixture and negative control pass |
| Audio RAM as the 128-byte 6532 mirror (A2) | `rtl/audio_ram_map.v`, `rtl/audio_board.v` | `sim/audio_ram` replay of MAME audio-CPU traces: Mouse Trap flat map 6,188 mismatches, mirror 0 | Compiled together; hardware unproved |
| 6840 at the real E clock, immediate load, timer-3 prescale (A4) | `modules/6840/berzerk_sound_fx.vhd`, `rtl/audio_board.v` | GHDL replay of real Venture writes: timers 3.986/3.986/0.498 of MAME formula before, 0.997 after | Compiled together; noise path and levels not compared |
| Audio-clock reset synchronizer; scoped false paths for the PIA handshake, static profile byte and the synchronizer's first flop | `rtl/reset_sync.v`, `rtl/audio_board.v`, `Arcade-Exidy2.sdc` | `sim/reset_sync`; owner timing runs | Complete local flow includes this change; corrected-clock master timing still fails on PIA return data, audio +0.082 ns. Reset and generated-clock coverage remains open |

Environment, tool versions, capture and test commands: [docs/cloud-environment.md](docs/cloud-environment.md). Details: [source audit](docs/audits/source/w05-w08-source-audit.md), [A3/A4](docs/audits/source/a3-a4-audio-effects.md), [timing diagnosis](docs/audits/source/audio-handshake-timing.md), [interrupt-latch survey](docs/reference_cases/int-latch-survey.json).

## Isolated expansion adapter (W02)
Increments 1-15 are in `docs/design/expansion-adapter/`. Increment 14/15: per-domain reset synchronizers in the candidate bridge, 29 connected expectations including the three actual ROM payloads (Mouse Trap CVSD, FAX, FAX 2) pass under Verilator 5.052; the exact probe passes the full Quartus flow (208 RAM blocks, 486 ALMs, 495 registers, all slacks positive, 7 synchronizer chains recognized). This is still standalone; the adapter is not wired into the core.

## Open items

Owner hardware/input gates:
- Close the timed PIA reply-byte failure and complete generated-clock/reset coverage; then test the audio changes (effects two octaves higher, both ears, Mouse Trap audio) and the interrupt profiles with `candidates/mra` against the baseline MRAs.
- Control requirements are supplied: Teeter spinner and joystick/D-pad; FAX four answer buttons per player. Exact CRT model/adapter/settings and running RBF/MRA remain to record; sensitivities/layout need hardware validation.

Doable in the cloud (MAME 0.264, Verilator 5.052, GHDL are installed; ROM zips for mtrap, fax, fax2, targ, spectar, pepper2, hardhat, sidetrac, teetert, venture are staged locally and uncommitted):
- 6840 noise generator and output level versus MAME WAVs (A4 follow-up); 8253 clocks (A5); Targ/Spectar discrete tone path (A7).
- Mouse Trap CVSD path: voice ROM loading is designed and verified in isolation, but local Z80 source exists, but no production speech CPU/CVSD integration exists (W09).
- Venture arrow case (I05): MAME room-entry reproduction not yet scripted; sprite-1 enable gating (S1) is not supported as the cause in the startup-to-maze capture.
- FAX `fxl-12b` PROM routing and banks 24-31 parity; Side Trak, Teeter Torture and FAX/FAX2 profiles (W10-W11); clone/bootleg profiles (W12).
- Remaining reset-release/clock integration of the expansion adapter into the core (actual clocks, CPU, audio) and whole-core fit.

Needs both: native/CRT video integration (W06-W07), per-set regression (W14), physical acceptance (W15), release packaging (W16).

Generated ROM/media/binaries/logs remain ignored under `simulation/`; no ROM bytes are committed. [WORKPLAN.md](WORKPLAN.md) remains the full game/issue tracker.

## Reviewed results

| Area | Accepted at this checkpoint | Still unaccepted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Video source boundary | Independent input-raster stimulus and queue pass eight bitplanes, all 65,536 pixels, first/last rows and column 255. Wrong expectation fails. Capture-to-output-register-update interval is 18 master clocks. | Production mixer elaboration, game-renderer tap, downstream consumer sampling, enabled gamma/FX/OSD, Native/CRT CDC/PLL/fit and physical output. |
| Sprites | Raw-address Venture right/fire and right-only cases; zero position mirrors in this sequence; exact accepted-bus/common-frame match. All 64 graphic images pass 16,384 source-primitive bits; negative fails. | Inside-room horizontal-shot reproduction/arrow identity, complete control-PROM/ROM-latency/window scheduling, clipping, per-game collision/IRQ and full CPU/frame parity. |
| Expansion transport | Index/skid, fresh read-drain handshake, reset/fault/abort closure; 21 synthetic connected cases and three actual ROM expansion cases pass. Baseline loader unchanged. | Reset-release synchronization, actual clocks/CPU/audio wiring, whole-core fit, remaining boundaries and FAX PROM/banks24..31 parity. Standalone fit is not full-core acceptance. |

[Sixth-block review](docs/design/sixth-block.md) links all evidence. The fifth-block video failure was resolved as a fixture input preparation/timestamp-origin error; it is not proof that production RGB/DE is broken. The original mixer generate-scope issue still needs Quartus elaboration evidence.

## Remaining current-unit work, in resume order

1. **Integrate the expansion adapter into the core.** Per-domain reset release is done and fit at probe level (increments 13-15). Next: bind actual clocks, CPU and audio, prove whole-core fit, then FAX PROM/bank parity and remaining boundaries.
2. **Complete serializer scheduling and actual symptom reproduction.** Instantiate source control PROM, actual ROM latency and gated-clock windows with independent bitmap expectations. The existing async PE-load model and synchronous TI component behavior cannot be swapped without revisiting clock wiring. Script room entry and horizontal firing; current outside-room control/image states select dot/blank graphics and do not identify the reported arrow. Compare clipping, pixel-time image selection and complete affected frames; verify collision masks/polarity and IRQ timing per game.
3. **Bind reviewed video queue to the real renderer and transport.** Preserve the independently measured input acceptance contract; verify actual game RGB/blanking and downstream consumer edges. Establish legal PLL/cascade/Native ownership, implement reviewed CRT scheduling/CDC/mode/geometry work and simulate complete images/effects/faults before the first production build.

## Broader work still pending

- W02: complete FPGA transport/read path, FAX extra `fxl-12b` PROM/decoder routing and out-of-region bank parity, FAX/FAX2 board RAM/maps, fitted memory budget.
- W03–W05: reference cases for remaining release games and missing/clone games; exact forum reproductions; sprites, collision/IRQ, mirrors and game-profile regressions through complete CPU execution and rendered frames.
- W08–W09: shared audio accuracy and complete Mouse Trap CVSD hardware/command/ROM execution; capture/compare each missing voice/sound event.
- W10–W12: Side Trak, Teeter Torture, FAX/FAX2 and clone/bootleg support, including controls and complete game acceptance. Existing ROM availability is not game support.
- W13–W16: frontend/persistence/effects integration, full-flow Quartus builds/timing/resource review, physical acceptance and only then release packaging/regression.

Existing owner inputs remain supplied: NAS ROM library, local MAME and repository releases. Owner supplied the video paths and control requirements above; exact adapter/settings and physical acceptance remain needed at their dependent gates. For the arrow case, first derive a room-entry reproduction from MAME; request an exact owner sequence only if it remains necessary. No new input is required to resume the immediate isolated adapter work.
